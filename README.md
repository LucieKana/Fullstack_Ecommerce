# Fullstack_Ecommerce on Autocar Parts.

I build a responsive  E-commerce Auto parts Spring Boot application based on MVC architecture (Model, View, Controller) in java Spring boot, JPA, Mysql, Thymeleaf implementing all CRUD operations, utilizing Entities, Controller classes, and Interfaces Establishes a connection with React project as a View layer that includes Components for CRUD operations responsive app, Media Queries, Accesses RESTful API from React project using axios and displays in a formatted view (CSS) includes router v6 functionality Backend Specifications

Uses MySql as a SQL database Uses Spring Tool Suite (STS) for Spring Boot application w/Maven as a build tool Uses MVC architecture Uses Apache Tomcat as a web server

The project is segmented into two parts:

The admin is my backend: In which I created an API on 9 differents car models, parts, year  on the backend using springboot and mysql and consumed it in my frontend(client) application.
 
I build components, make them communicate with each other and retrieve/send data from/to the API.

Finally I merge both applications into one, packaged web app inside the static folder.

## Will complete the deployment on Heroku later,I need to learn how to deploy it.
