# Fullstack_Ecommerce on Autocar Parts.

E-commerce Auto parts application was built in java Spring boot, JPA, Mysql, Thymeleaf
The main idea of this project is to buid a full stack application to sale auto car parts.
My project is segmented into two parts:
The admin is my backend: In which I created an API on 9 differents car models, parts, year  on the backend using springboot and consumed it in my frontend(client) application made in React.
 
I build components, make them communicate with each other and retrieve/send datafrom/to the API.

Finally I merge both ap[plications into one, packaged web app inside the static folder.

## Will complete the deployment on Heroku
